So this is my attempt to write a (simple?) RayTracer while learning to work with TypeScript.

Definitely a work in progress, but feel free to copy/share/laugh at as you please.

Notes

* The RayTracer expects some textures (in ~/Jiri.RayTracer/wwwroot/textures/), but since I don't have any rights to the images I'm using I've decided to exclude them from this repository. Simply find your own textures and put them in the specified folder (and update the width and height of the textures in init.ts).
